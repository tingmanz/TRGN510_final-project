## Overview of project: 
- RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression profiling. It can effectively detect the expressed genes between different conditions over the genome-wide level. For my project, I am interested in comparing differences in kidney cancer gene expression between white female patients age from 20-60 versus African American female patients age from 20-60. I would use the Bioconductor to analyze the RNA-seq in the HT-seq counts file. And this is the vignette I would use https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/limmaWorkflow.html

## Data
- White female patient(10 samples from TCGA database on the [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/):

## Milestone 1:
- I would download the files from the National Cancer Institute GDC Data Portal website and load these data to R. Then I will set up limma, glimma and edgeR library in my RStudio. I would also check the format of my files and make sure the data can be transformed from raw data to usable data and can be processed by Bioconductor. Furthermore, I would calculate some values such as cpm, lcpm, mean and median. 

## Milestone 2:
- I would analyze the data effectively and understand more about RNA-seq. I would display or draw some plots such as heatmaps (show expression level), MDS plot (an informative representation of the similarities and dissimilarities in a sample) and some boxplots to better analyze my data.
